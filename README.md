# Root-Mask-and-Skeletons

Desktop application (PyQt6 + PyTorch) for **plant-root phenotyping** from
minirhizotron images. Pipeline:

```
image → ResNet mask → manual mask trace → Pix2Pix skeleton →
skeleton-correction GUI → root length (mm) & area (mm²) → CSV → Dash/Plotly viz
```

The goal is to make root insights broadly available: quantitative metrics
exported as CSV plus interactive web visualizations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- A CUDA GPU is recommended for inference (CPU works but is slow).

## Installation

PyTorch is **installed separately** so the build matches your CUDA toolkit and
pip cannot silently downgrade you to a CPU wheel:

```bash
# 1. GPU build (example: CUDA 12.8). Use the index that matches your CUDA.
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
#    CPU-only alternative:
#    pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# 2. Application dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. (optional) development / test tooling
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Model checkpoints are not committed; place them under `checkpoints/`
(`mask_weights/best_mask_model_V5.pth`, `skeletonizer/latest_net_G.pth`).

## Running

```bash
python main.py
```

## Tests

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen pytest          # Linux/macOS
$env:QT_QPA_PLATFORM='offscreen'; pytest  # Windows PowerShell
```

The suite pins the scientific calibration (length/area), skeleton vectorization,
CSV schema, and imports of every app module.

## Calibration & measurement notes

Metrics are derived from the camera's physical field of view (default
**18 mm × 13 mm**, see `app/config.py::Calibration`) mapped onto the **actual**
image/mask resolution, so they are resolution-independent:

- **Area** = root pixels × (FOV_w/width) × (FOV_h/height). A fully-root mask
  measures the whole FOV (234 mm²) at any resolution.
- **Length** uses a true arc-length estimator: orthogonal pixel steps cost one
  pixel pitch, diagonal steps cost the Euclidean diagonal (per-axis pitch).

If your imaging system has a different FOV, change it in one place:
`app/config.py`.

## Code review

A full multi-agent code review of this codebase lives in
[`CODE_REVIEW.md`](CODE_REVIEW.md), with machine-readable findings in
`code_review_findings.json` and an interactive knowledge graph in
`code_review_graph/graph.html`. The hardening work it drove is summarized in
[`REMEDIATION_REPORT.md`](REMEDIATION_REPORT.md).
